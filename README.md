# PyRush 🔫
Pyrush is a Python project based on PytactX program we studied in class, that was created by Julien Arné, our teacher.
Here's the link of PytactX : https://replit.com/
## Context and specifications 📓
Since the start of our IS class, we had, after learning instructions using PytactX, to create a project reusing everything we learnt in Python.
In a group of 3, we decided to use the ADN of shooting games : a territory capture
## Description ❓
Our game is a mix between Tag and Shooter game. 
## Rules 📜
When the game starts, 2 teams of 3 peoples fight to get in the ennemy's territory. A game lasts after 3 minutes of game. The winning team is the group who has te most points
### How to score points ? 🎯
The team can score a point if one of the player steps into the ennemy's spawn zone.
### What happens when you get killed ? 💀
When you are killed, you have to wait 3 seconds before you respawn in the map. You have unlimited respawn.
