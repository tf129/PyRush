Pyrush is a Python project based on PytactX (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0) we studied in class, that was created by Julien Arné (Jusdeliens), our teacher.
Here's the link of the PytactX V2 replit: https://replit.com/@jusdeliens/pytactxv2
## Context and specifications 📓
Since the start of our comupter sciences class and after learning instructions using PytactX, to create a project reusing everything we learnt in Python, we created this game named PyRush.
In a group of 3, we decided to use the DNA of shooting games : a territory capture
## Description ❓
Our game is a mix between Tag and Shooter game. 
## Rules 📜
When the game starts, 2 teams of 3 peoples fight to get in the ennemy's territory. A game lasts after 3 minutes of game. The winning team is the group who has the most points
### How to score points ? 🎯
The team can score a point if one of the player steps into the ennemy's spawn zone.
### What happens when you get killed ? 💀
When you are killed, you have to wait 3 seconds before you respawn in the map. You have unlimited respawn.
### What happens when you kill an ennemy agent ? 💥🔫
When you kill an ennemy agent in your team zone, you have a 35% chance of dropping a PowerUp.
### List of PowerUp ⭐
Illimited ammo during 3sec  
Sniper mode (one shot but you have a 3sec cooldown between 2 shots)  
Shield during 3sec  
Heal (you recover half your lost HP)  
Invisibility during 2sec  
5 coins (à voir pour supprimer)
